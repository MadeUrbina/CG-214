    <!--Before class paragraph-->
    <p>For the last 2 years, I knew this moment will come. The moment that I'll have to go to <b>Web Page Construction</b> class and learn the very scary <b>CODE.</b> The idea freaked me out a bit. </p>

     <p>Meantime, I was enjoying my other textiles class like <i>Hand Screen Pinting.</i> I often look for websites that will teach more of <a href="http://www.3rdrailpresents.co.uk/tag/screen-printing/">Screen Printing process</a>. I love to go to the FIT Screen Printing Lab and work on my proyects. </p>

      <!--In Class paragraph-->
    <p>Once my Web Page Construction class started, I tried my best to focus and understand the basics of code. It takes me some time for the information to sink in. I get it (sort of) at the very end. I know my teacher tries to explains things in the simplest way <i>possible</i> but still I get very confused. There were moments that I felt like throwing the computer away.</p>

   <!--About Brackets-->
        <p>Learning about <a href="http://brackets.io"> Brackets</a> is a new intense experience and I know that it has just started so I better keep it together. I might need <a href="http://www.apa.org/topics/therapy/"> professional therapy</a> after this class is over. On my little research about <b>Brackets Extensions</b>, I found the <a href="http://brackets.dnbard.com/extension/mirorauhala.bootstrap-skeleton"> Bootstrap Skeleton</a> which seems very interesting.</p>
        
         <img src="images/bootstrap_skeleton.jpg" alt text="New Bootstrap Document" title="How to use Bootstrap skeleton extension."/>
        
        <p>This extension contains HTML- and CSS-based <i>design templates</i> for typography, buttons and other interface components. I know this will ease the development of dynamic websites that is the type I like. I also watched this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJD7GdXAnpQ"> "How to add bootstrap skeleton plugin in Bracket"</a> which I haven't tried to do but I will at some point and hopefully I don't make a disaster.

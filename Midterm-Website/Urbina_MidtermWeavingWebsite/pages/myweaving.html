            </p>
            
            <p>
            As a peruvian, I grew up surrounded by beautiful textiles especially handmade wovens. Even though I did not weave when I was living in Peru, I have always been attracted to weaving and all techniques to create complex patterns. My first weaving class at FIT was great. It felt like going back to my roots and it was not hard to understand. Through practicing, I have grown to love more weaving in the last 2 years. Now, it is no longer a hobby but a part of my career as textile designer.
